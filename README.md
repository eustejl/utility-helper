# Compilation of utility helper codes

This contains my collection of personal codes that have been helpful in 
- manipulating files, e.g. images and texts
- manipulating folders
- parsing data from files
- et cetera

Lines ending with `# !` have arguments or parameters that the user must define. It is important to double-check these before running the codes.
